### Hi there 👋 I am Daniele

- 💼 I’m currently working as Software Engineer @Zopa 
- ❤️ I love coding in Kotlin and Java
- 🏋️ I’d love to work more with Scala and Haskell
- ⚡ Fun fact: My profile picture is an espresso ☕ because I love italian coffee and my first language as a professional software engineer was Java
